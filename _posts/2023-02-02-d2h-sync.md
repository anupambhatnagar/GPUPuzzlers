title: The fastest way to add?
permalink: /posts/fastest-way-to-add/
excerpt: This puzzle presents three different ways to add elements of a tensor. Can you figure out the fastest implementation?
---


The code snippet below sums up the elements in a 1D tensor in three different ways. Which implementation
is the fastest, which one is the slowest and why?

``` python
def first_sum():
    total = 0.0
    for i in range(tensor.size()[0]):
        total += tensor[i].cpu()
    return total

def second_sum():
    total = torch.zeros(1, device='cuda')
    for i in range(tensor.size()[0]):
        total += tensor[i]
    return total

def third_sum():
    total = 0.0
    tensor_on_cpu = tensor.cpu()
    for i in range(tensor_on_cpu.size()[0]):
        total += tensor_on_cpu[i]
    return total
```
