title: The faster way to add?
permalink: /posts/faster-way-to-add/
excerpt: This puzzle presents three different ways to add elements of a tensor. Can you figure out the fastest implementation?
---

The code snippet below sums up the elements in a 1D tensor in three different ways. Which
implementation is the fastest, which one is the slowest and why?

``` python
def first_sum(a_tensor):
    total = 0.0
    for i in range(a_tensor.size()[0]):
        total += a_tensor[i].cpu()
    return total

def second_sum(a_tensor):
    total = torch.zeros(1, device='cuda')
    for i in range(a_tensor.size()[0]):
        total += a_tensor[i]
    return total

def third_sum(a_tensor):
    total = 0.0
    tensor_on_cpu = a_tensor.cpu()
    for i in range(tensor_on_cpu.size()[0]):
        total += tensor_on_cpu[i]
    return total


torch.manual_seed(145) # Fun fact: 145 = 1! + 4! +5!
data = torch.rand(2**12, device='cuda')

sum1 = first_sum(data)
sum2 = second_sum(data)
sum3 = third_sum(data)
```
